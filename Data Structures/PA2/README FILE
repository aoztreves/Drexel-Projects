README FILE FOR PA2 For ASLAN OZTREVES

Every Implementation done, works.
Testing is included in Programs file, please see for more. Every test has been passed by my code.
Timing is also included in Programs file, please see for more. Timing of every implementation
	1)LOCTREE
	2)LCRSTREE
are all included in PDF file.
I have included the pictures i used to derive my conclusion, you can find those pictures in Pictures folder.




My main function includes all the testing and the timing operations.All of them are linked together.
For makefile, first you need to call the makefile by make in order to create executables, then the program basicly runs the program by "./build" because thats is going to be the executable file by itself.
For testing purposes I included all of the test of those file within the “testing” file but make fill execute every test and what file is needed.
You don’t have to call make clean or anything because it is being done in one segment
Every file is inlcuded in the main so it will call in that order.

Thanks for your time.
