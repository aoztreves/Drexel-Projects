README

People that worked on this project are Linfeng,Elliot,Jake and Aslan Oztreves. We have done problems through 1 to 7 excluding 5. Every problem has their own test implemented inside of the file. You can call any of the indicated problems in the problems file by their indicated name in the submittion guideliness.

We were supposed to do the problem 5 as well but then we realized that it would exceed the amount of points we can get so we decided to not do question 5, rather than that the person,Aslan, have done the makefile,problems and readme so that everything can be equal

All the reports are included in the report folder.
