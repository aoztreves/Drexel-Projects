CS475: Project 2
One-Time Pads

In this project, we will explore why it's never a good idea to reuse your one-time pads. I’ve provided six messages encrypted with three one-time pads in the attached tar ball. 

The problem has three parts, each worth equal points.

1. Discuss your approach to solving this problem. Consider the ASCII encoding system, the mathematical properties of exclusive-or, predictability of human and computer languages, and any other factors that will help you solve this problem.

2. Determine which pairs of ciphertext were encrypted using the same "one-time" pads. 

3. Report the six plaintexts. 

Hints:
* Each pad was used exactly twice. 
* One of the messages is code, one of the messages is song lyrics, and one of the messages is a Shakespeare quotation. The other three are other memorable phrases. 
* The following links may be helpful:

1) For this problem we have used XOR to find the plain text without having the actual key becuase of double usage of one time pad. We first did all the combinations of the ct.hex files, then tried couple key words like 'the' to find the matches then after the first match it was easier to match because of the small amount of files. Then we used crib drag because the ascii values goes up one by one thus when we tried the first 3 then 2 3 4. thus when matched we were able to see readable words. It was based on a lot of guesses, I have used a most frequently used words dictionary that i found online. You can find the matches on top of the plaintext.

And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate,
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake,


We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
