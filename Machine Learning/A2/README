Homework #2

How To Run the Code:
	I have used MATLAB to run my code. No external libraries were added.
	You can run HW2.m file and it should compile.

Notes:

	There were many problems I faced. I wasn't able to do reduction of dimension so I did 2D. After couple tries 6th and 7th feature seemed like the closest to the figures given on the hw and other features looked odd. So I tried my code with k=2 and features 6 and 7.

	I wasn't able to get to the purity so that is missing.

Thank you.
