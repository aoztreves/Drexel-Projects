Homework #1

How To Run the Code:
	I have used MATLAB to run my code. No external libraries were added.
	For PCA, please run the PCA.m file, there should be no problem.
	For EigenValues part, I wasn't able to produce the last 2 parts, right. I have found a value for k, which is 37. I don't have the folowwing 2 parts working.
