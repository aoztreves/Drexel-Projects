README FILE FOR LAB 1 CS275 - ASLAN OZTREVES

Start of the Page -
	Starting my web-page with a little bit of history of fibonnacci sequences as a paragraph, then there is a great self explanatory picture to accommodate the paragraph.
How to Create Your Own -
	If you would like to create a fibonnacci sequence with the number of your own choice then all you have to do is; write the number you want to the text field down under the "Fibonnacci numbers are fun" sentence.
	Pressing the 'Compute!' button would create a table with the sequence and its paired number on to the left of the fibonnacci number.
How to Reset All -
	To reset all process on the site and return to the initial page; press 'Reset Table!', right to the 'Compute!' button.
