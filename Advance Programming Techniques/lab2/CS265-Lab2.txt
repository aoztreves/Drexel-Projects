Q 1: What is the output?

Q 4: What were the results?
- Lines - 97 breadIsDangerous.txt
- Characters - 2960 breadIsDangerous.txt

Q 5: How could you use grep, wc (with the -l option), and a pipe to find how many lines contain the string "the"?
- grep "the" breadIsDangerous.txt | wc -l . That is what I used and the answer I got is 8.
Q 6: What is different?
- I went to a gadren party
This line is fine
bnuch of my old freinds did somehting

As is this one
 This was the text before after I executed the file now its this.
 I went to a garden party
This line is fine
bunch of my old friends did something

As is this one
The program changed gadren to garden,bnuch to bunch and freinds to friends and finally somehting to something.
Q 7: Explain the output?
- 1c1
< I went to a garden party
---
> I went to a gadren party
3c3
< bunch of my old friends did something
---
> bnuch of my old freinds did somehting
6d5
< An extra line
 This is the output that i got before I changed everything with ispell. the only difference is the "an extra line".
 Q 8: What did you see this time?
 - There was nothing came out because there is obviously no difference between the same files.
Q 9: Explain the different return values (the man pages might help)
I got three different returns, 0,1 and 2. 0 means that grep dough breadIsDangerous.txt worked perfectly but the others didnt because we know that in unix 0 means true and everything else means not true.
