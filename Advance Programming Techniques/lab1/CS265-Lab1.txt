Q1: Describe when the shell invokes .bashrc, and when it invokes .bash_profile.
-I think bashrc is for the default options as well as what you can save to opening bash, the shell but profile is where it reads its commands.
Q2:Complete all edits in this file, as directed by the file, save as vi_lab, and submit along w/your lab.
-Done.
Q3: Do an ls -l . What do you see?
-I see these:
total 80
-rw-rw-r--  1 ao428 ao428   166 Sep 24 19:15 hello.cc
drwxrwxr-x  2 ao428 ao428     6 Sep 24 20:08 lab1
-rw-rw-r--  1 ao428 ao428 33136 Sep 25 15:11 Test
-rw-rw-r--  1 ao428 ao428   515 Sep 25 15:15 TEST
-rw-rw-r--+ 1 ao428 ao428 33720 Sep 25 15:55 vi_lab
Q4: If you enter chmod 644 some_file , what permissions did you give to whom?
-it is read and write for the user,just read for the group and the world.
Q5: If you enter chmod 755 some_file , what permissions did you give to whom?
- it is read, write and execute for me(user) and read and execute for groups and world.
Q6: Can you read your funny file?
-Yes, for now I can read the file.
Q7: Can you read your hello.bash file?
-Yes, for now I can read the file.
Q8: Were you successful?
-Yes, it worked.
Q9: What are 2 ways of giving yourself execute permission on this file?
-I would say anything that starts with chmod 7** and also anything starts with chmod 3** or for extra I can start with chmod 1**.
Q10: What happened?
-It is giving me an error I think i only have the permission for read and not the others so I have to change my permission then try to change it I guess.
-I had to override it with the :w! command.
Q11: What is the output of each of these?
-ls * - it list everything inside of the current repository as well as the whatever the folder holds
-ls a* - This only showed annoy and annoy.cc . I think it only shows the files with initial letter a.
-ls *m* -This showed itemList  itemList-2cols  TelecomTruths these. I think it shows the files which contains the letter m.
-ls anno? - it only showed annoy.
-ls annoy? - it said there is no file or repository. I think this one shows the file if you are missing by just one letter, if not it doesnt show anything.
Q12: What happened?
-It created 3 different files with names ; 1)vi 2)a 3)space not single file with "vi a space" name.
Q13: Record the output:
- echo Is a < b? - nothing because there are no quotes.
- echo "Is a < b?" - the out put is Is a < b
- echo "\$USER is $USER" - the output is $USER is ao428.
- echo '\$USER is $USER' - the output is \$USER is $USER.
- echo "Today is `date`" - the output is Today is Sun Sep 25 17:18:56 EDT 2016
- echo "Today is $(date)" - the output is Today is Sun Sep 25 17:19:36 EDT 2016
- echo 'Today is `date`' - the output is Today is `date`
- echo -e "Files that start w/e:\n`ls e*`" - the output is 
ls: cannot access 'e*': No such file or directory
Files that start w/e: 
I didnt understand why this was returned.
Q14: What is the difference between sort itemList-2cols and sort -n itemList-2cols?
- The difference between both of them is that the first one is randomly orders the lists the latter one list the items in a numberly order.
Q15: How would you list the 8 items in itemList-2cols w/the highest numbers, in descending order?
-After a lot of tries, I found out that pipe can be behind the command thats why I was getting that weird situation where i couldn't put any commands in. I found the solution by trial and error which is sort -rn itemList-2cols | head -n8 .
Q16: The tar file is gone. What is in its place?
-There is a new file in it's place which is lab1.tar.gz.
Q17: What happened to the *.tgz file?
- It was a .tgz file then after our slick moves it turned into a tar file back again.
Q18: Show the grep used to find if any files in this lab directory mention "Vacation".
-grep -R 'Vacation' ./ is the command I used to find the Vacation string which is in this file ./TelecomTruths: and in this sentence "Vacation" is something you roll over to next year, or a check you get.
Q19: Put the find command you used above here in your labsheet.
- I got this results which I think proves that it finds lab1 

find -P "lab1" ./
