Homework #2

How To Run the Code:
	I have used MATLAB to run my code. No external libraries were added.
	You can run A2.m.

Notes:

	I didnt face any problems. You can find the theory problems done in a piece of paper which is all in the pdf. I answered every question. You can find the tittles on top of the images. For part 5 I took a photo on my phone for paper but it was too big size, so it gave me a runtime error after trying 2 times, I decided to show with a classic Matlab image the 'cameraman.tif' You can find the screenshots I took in the screenshots folder.


Thank you.
