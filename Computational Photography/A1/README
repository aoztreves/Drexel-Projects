Homework #1

How To Run the Code:
	I have used MATLAB to run my code. No external libraries were added.
	You can run Part*.m files where * is the part number and it should compile.

Notes:

	I didnt face any problems. You can find the picture I used 'test.jpg'. Theory Problems and all screenshots on theory problems pdf. Screenshots folder has all the pictures of the graphs and required documents.

Thank you.
