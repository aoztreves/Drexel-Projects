ReadME

I couldnt get the matching work so, matching doesnt work.

when inputing for multiple choice you have to enter one by one, not with spaces.

Or else everything else is working.

I have added IO class in order to validate the inputs, it wasnt in my UML before.

I tried to change the namings because of Mr.Salvages comments on my UML.

From his comments, i also add couple more constructors which helped me a lot.

You can find the Serialized files in SFiles and they are seperated into two groups, test and survey.They also include one full test 5 different type of questions, since matching doesnâ€™t work.
